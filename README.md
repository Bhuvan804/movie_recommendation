# movie_recommendation
Movie recommendation System using Datset -> Movielense 100k Dataset <br />
Libraries used- Numpy,Pandas <br />
This project takes in a movie name,say Titanic (1997), and creates a dataset of Titanic (1997), with ratings given by its reviewers. <br />
Now this dataset is used to correlate (using Pandas' 'corrwith' function) on the reviewers basis. <br />
A threshold of minimum 100 reviews has been applied for more accurate results. <br />
